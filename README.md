This website serves as my professional and academic CV. I used HTML and CSS to build the résumé. I set up an AWS S3 bucket and a Static Website.
I obtained an SSL Certificate through Certificate Manager, which includes CloudFront for improved distribution and security of the website,
after I utilise Route 53 and update the DNS entries to point to the CloudFront distribution.
