This website serves as my professional and academic CV. I used HTML and CSS to build the résumé. I set up an AWS S3 bucket and a Static Website.
I obtained an SSL Certificate through Certificate Manager, which includes CloudFront for improved distribution and security of the website.
After I utilised Route 53 and updated the DNS entries to point to the CloudFront distribution.
